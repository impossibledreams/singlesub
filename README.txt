This project is another answer to the so called "Yahoo" problem
originally mentioned by Dave
Winer (http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/01/12). What this
project does is provide a list of subscribe URLs for common aggregators
in three different formats (OPML, RSS 2.0 and RDF) AND provides
three different services for blog publishers (hover-over subscribe button,
chicklet generator and HTML subscribe page).

The main premise behind this project is that subscription information
for aggregators can be stored in XML format and then used to generate
different types of subscription utilities. I store this information in
OPML format and then use XSLT templates to generate six different types
of utilities. The beauty of this approach is that by changing the original
XML file, all of the six utilities generated by this project are automatically
updated. It is also hoped that other websites and utilities will use this
service to auto-update their own tools.

Please see the INSTALL file for installation instructions. Detailed usage information
can be found on the project website at http://singlesub.sf.net.
